              <h2>Dollar to Naira Black Market Rate Today<br/>
              How much is Dollar to Naira Today in Black Market</h2>
              <p>
                The Dollar to Naira Black Market rate remains unpredictable as it continues to remain volatile. As a Nigerian who is either involved in payment of school fees abroad or just wants to ship in items from overseas, you have to note that black market or Abokifx rate, officially known as the parallel market rate, often reflects real-time demand and supply on the go. Hence, the market is inherently volatile and most often, movements are against the Naira.
              </p>

  <h2>Why is the Black Market Rate higher than the Official Rate?</h2>
  <p>
    Just like you all know, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is mandated to regulate Nigeria's foreign currency supply, which means they oversee the supply chain—and history has proven that the supply has never been enough to cool down the market or meet the increasing demand. Consequently, this scarcity of much-needed dollars forces Nigerians and business entities to keep patronising the parallel market, because dollars can be gotten at any point in time but at a much higher price.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, Nigeria being a largely import-dependent nation consistently faces quite high demand for dollars. There are several factors responsible for this trend, including imports, travel, education, and commercial activities. Because the Central Bank of Nigeria cannot clear the backlog demand for dollars, businesses and individuals now source it wherever they can.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, inconsistency in Nigerian government policies and a tight grip on currency controls have been noted to contribute significantly to widening the gap between the Central Bank of Nigeria (official rate) and the black market rates. Many bottlenecks exist in the banking sector when it comes to accessing dollars, making the parallel market thrive.
