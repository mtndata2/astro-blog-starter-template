**Nigerian Employers: Here Are Some Retention Strategies for Keeping Valuable Employees**

Everyone gets tired of doing the same thing over time. When you repeat a process continuously, it gets to a stage that you do not want to continue any longer. This is absolutely normal as the human mind has been designed to explore different things and not just stick to one thing.

This also applies to employees who work for their bosses. When they get employed at first, everything goes on smoothly, but it gets to a point that they get tired and want to quit the job. Like I said earlier, it is absolutely normal for this to happen but the period can be extended.

If you work at a place where everything seems conducive, it will take a longer time before you get tired of working there. Employers are usually the ones who can affect how long their employees work for them, so they have a lot of work to do to retain them.

If you are an employer reading this, you will find several things you could be doing presently that could make your employees easily get tired of working with you. Also, you could discover new ways or ideas to further prolong their stay at your workplace. Employers actually want employees who could work with them long term.

Having long-term employees at your workplace will help save a lot of time and energy you would have used in explaining the whole process to newbies or new recruits. The old employees gain enough experience that at a point, your supervision is not needed anymore.

**How do you retain your staff as an Employer?**

### INVEST IN YOUR EMPLOYEES' TRAINING

Employees care about their growth. Their employers also do. When you as the employer pay for their trainings, seminars, and courses which can add to their growth and at the same time boost their work profile, your employees find joy with you and will want to stay for as long as possible.

After paying for their trainings, they get to grow in the field where they work. They will surely apply the new things they have learned at your workplace, enhancing the growth of the company. Also, this shows your employees that you care about their growth and take it as a priority.

### TWEAK YOUR RECRUITMENT STRATEGY

A common mistake most employers make is that during recruitment, they just employ people without proper screening and a concrete strategy. This might allow you to employ the wrong people who will eventually leave, because they did not fit the position in the first instance.

Focus your interviews and recruitment on people with skills and high levels of interest in these roles. When they have both, they tend to stay longer because they won't get tired of the job.

### DESIGN THE RIGHT BENEFIT PACKAGE

Many, if not all, employees work in direct proportion to the money they are being paid. Therefore, ensure what you are paying your employees suits the kind of job you are offering them. Do not pay them lesser than they should be paid and ensure their paychecks are not delayed for whatsoever reason. Their paychecks should come on time and as at when due.

### SET REALISTIC GOALS FOR YOUR STAFF

Do not set targets that do not look feasible for your employees. Give them projects that you, as the employer, can handle without finding it too stressful. If at any time your employees see the job as too stressful or demanding, they will tend to leave.

### MAKE THE WORKPLACE FUN

Let your staff work with you, not just for you. Don't see them as subordinates but as partners. Set out days for them to work from home if possible, or sponsor their lunch occasionally. This helps ease tension, stress, and pressure. Do not allow the workplace to be boring. A flexible environment encourages longer employee retention.

### MAKE THE COMPANY POLICIES EASY TO COMPREHEND FROM THE BEGINNING

From the point of employment, disclose the company's vision and mission statement to them. Elaborate on what they need to do to keep the company running smoothly. Ensure they are aware of their roles and how they contribute to the company's success.
