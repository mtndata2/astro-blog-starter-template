**Want instant business Growth? Consider these 5 technological strategies**

Looking back on how business was carried out years ago and now, it shows a great difference.

Decades ago there weren’t things like smartphones, internet, email, mobile marketing etc. What we had in place were handbills, typewriter, land phones and others.

Times have changed and there are so many innovations thanks to modern technology. Now communication is instantaneous, one can communicate immediately via the internet, phone calls and emails.

The good thing is that these innovations have made businesses succeed better, because of improved way of operation through the use of modern technology. With the use of these technologies, even small local businesses have been able to metamorphose into international businesses.

Here are the 5 ways by which businesses are growing through technology.

## The use of payroll system

This is one innovation by technology that is helping businesses to improve their accuracy and efficiency as it concerns staff payment.

Payroll system is a basic part of any business today. This is because companies are urging employees to ask for refunds or reimbursements through apps. These way employees are also given the chance of having access to their hour tax, pay cheques and other relevant information through the companies’ online portals.

Of course this will eliminate the multiplication of papers which would have form as receipts and note for evidence. With technology, staff just need internet access and the payment information would have been gotten in a breeze. So through this automation, the process of paying employees wouldn’t be a herculean task any longer.

Again, some payroll systems not only help to improve efficiency, they also offer a wealth of information which will help companies take strategic decisions. It doesn’t come as a shock the way payroll system is taking the centre stage for independent companies that prepare their payroll and even for consultants that are hired by companies to do their payrolls.

## The art of communication

The means of communication has evolved greatly that it can be done in a breeze. The era of waiting for a week-long response from a recipient before a business deal can be concluded is over.

With cell phones now, business deals can be concluded in minutes no matter the volume. The advent of cell phones has helped both owners of companies and employees to work more efficiently and effectively. Cell phone has become like a power house for staying connected and very helpful when it comes to swift response to clients’ enquiries.

Nothing beats a business with good customer care service with light-speed intervention when the need arises. It is really life-saving as these devices can be used for other things like exchange of emails, access to the internet and the use of business applications.

There’s also the use of it for social networking and exchange of text messages that businesses leverage on to attract more customers and clients. So the art of communication is made quite simple, clear and easy now for everyone. Most especially, it has improved both internal and external communication for all businesses.

## Provision of teleconferencing

There are business transactions that will need more than 2-3 persons from a company to take a decision before the commencement of the deal. This is made possible now with the use of teleconferencing. The most advanced one now is web conferencing where it has brought together collaborative online meetings, audio and webcams. This can help make interaction more effective.

With all these, participants can see one another, work together on documents presented, come to a compromise and finally take an agreeable decision. So with teleconferencing, small businesses have been allowed to extend their business to the outside world. Businesses can be done easily without restriction of boundaries.

## It aids in marketing

Before now, marketing products and services outside one’s vicinity or country was a huge task. Even with promotional facilities, there was still the clog, since the coverage and reach were limited. But the bar has been lifted now.

With internet marketing, small businesses are having tremendous growth because the restrictions have been lifted. There are numerous ways to reach the outer world now: there’s email marketing, advertising in search engines, having an informational website, down to advertising on all social media platforms.

The reach is wider now and it is cost-effective since a lot of promotion can be done free on one’s account, with a newsletter, through business updates and offering of coupons.
